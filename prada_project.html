        <p class="content_text">The project is to work on an Italian brand that operates in the luxury, fashion or arts sectors. In this case, the selected brand to work on is Prada. The goal is to analyse the brandâ€™s digital presence, its social media strategy and digital communication approach. Present a preliminary concept for a digital campaign for the brand using a chosen medium such as a mini-site, a social strategy and an email campaign. <br>

        <p class="content_text">My approach on this project was to deeper understand the brand Prada. One way is to know about Fondazione Prada, which is either an art gallery, a public museum or a private foundation founded by Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli since 1995.

          The intention for the architecture was to make old and new work seamlessly, where people wont be able to tell at any moment, whether they are in an old building or a new one. This is the concept behind the brand Prada.

         <p>For my project I decided to use the concept of new and old for the brand website design. On the homepage, there would be new products section and the timeless, iconic products. </p>
