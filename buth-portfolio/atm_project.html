        <p class="content_text">The project is the restyling of an ATM application. The main pain of the project consisted of UX, UI and prototype building of the application. 

        UX :  To analyse the flow and application structure on the key functions, and it has to be responsive.

        UI : To study how to improve the look and feel of the WebApp. Considering the text styles, icons, colour and other relevant design elements.

        Prototype :  To build the full design for mobile application prototype.

        <p class="content_text">The project is a Group project of four groupmates. Our goal is to restyle the existing application for users to use the application more efficiently. 

        Before the designing of the application, we did a user testing on ATM kiosk to observe users behaviour while using the kiosk.

          The user testing assisted us to know what is the priority for users when they are using the ATM kiosk, so that we could apply the important and necessary parts into the building of ATM application prototype. 

          We started from the discussion of the existing application and how could we improve. We share our ideas on the design layout, functionally  font styles, icons and colour. We divided the work on research part and designing the prototype.
